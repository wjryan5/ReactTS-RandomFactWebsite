# ReactTS-RandomFactWebsite

This is the first project I made with React (excluding tutorials) to use what I have learned. I used a random fact API from uselessfacts.jsph.pl and called it using Axion to display on button press. I wish to expand on this in the future
Thank you for taking the time to take a look!
